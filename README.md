`If you find any errors or got ideas for something new, please start an issue. Either we do it or you do it yourself`

Collaboration of random students working on calculators or algorythms for a math project.
Main cause is to learn JavaScript and have fun doing some stuff.

We want to bring as many calculators as possible into this.
If you have any ideas for implementations you can start a new issue and hope we are not to dump to do it
or you fork this project and implement it yourself.

### How to start
- Start with `yarn start` or `npm start`
- You can view it in your Browser (http://localhost:3000)
- If you have any issues starting with npm -> Try installing yarn `npm i --global yarn`

### Status
- Algebra (EEA, Eulerische Phi Funktion, Ordnung finden, Koprime-Restgruppen)
- Graphen (Gale-Shapley, Havel-Hakimi, Graphen erkennung, Graphendarstellung etc.)
- Kombinatorik (shiny golden things are in)
- Logik (KV-Diagramme -> KNF,DNF)
- DARK MODE!!! (Based on your System settings)

### In Progress
- More features for "Graphen"
- Testing everything
- Localisation
- For more see the issue List
